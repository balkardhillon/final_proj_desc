                     SMILE WEATHER APPLICATION

How will be the weather today? What should I wear? Should I take a Raincoat or a 
Jacket with me ? Should we go out on this weekend? and the doubts continue...
These are few of the questions which everybody thinks and asks himself but has 
no answer for them. 
So, The Application which I am building is a WEATHER forcast Application named
"SMILE WEATHER FORCAST" which would give answers to quite a few of the questions
of the user and will make life their easy.

This application is one of its own kind which include the weather forcast for 
the day and the next coming week also. Not only this but also this App would
inculde the other things like temperature, Humidity of the day and intutive 
datas for the coming weeks. This App works with Internet and GPS. GPS traces 
your exact location and tells the current weather and the forcast for the same.
You can also specify the Location manually.

The app would be developed using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT file.

For this we need to create different elements and variables with different 
IDs like for temperature , humidity etc. I will use the static Images for icons
depicting the different weather conditions. I will be adding a special feature 
of the background change according to different weather for example it turns 
orange in the sunny weather and navy blue in rain and storm. The user can
refresh the app own his own else it refreshes after every 15 minutes
automatically also.
However the user would not be able to make any changes but can just add, delete 
and select the loactions and can refresh it.
One may be able to run this app on both the platforms ie. Android as well as 
iOS.
